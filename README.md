### Hey, there! Check out some of my other projects outside of GitHub:

- [Lorenzi's Jisho](https://jisho.hlorenzi.com): Japanese-English dictionary, with a completely custom Single-Page App front-end library. I've put in a lot of effort for this library, working on smooth animations and page switching -- I think it turned out beautiful!

- [Game Boards](https://gb.hlorenzi.com): Online registry for team matches and tournament lounges of competitive games, like Mario Kart. It still uses an old front-end architecture... It's probably going to be the next thing I'll revamp!

- [...Some other projects can be found on my homepage!](https://hlorenzi.com)
